Reconstruction for TITUS



To build:
In WChSandBox directory
 source setupLite.sh
In WChRecoSandBox directory
 make
Load the WChRecoSandBox/lib/libWCLAnalysis.so and run macros


To run the reconstruction there are two steps:
 1. Photon mask
 2. Event reconstruction



Photon Mask: scripts/PhotonMask.C
Select photons from WChSandBox output which are detected according to detector configuration.
void PhotonMask(
  TString filename,     // path to WChSandBox FullEvent.root file
  TString genfilename,  // path to WChSandBox generatorcardfile.root file
  TString outfilename  // path to photon mask output file
  string sizeSetting    //choice of PMT type to be used
  double darkRate       //the dark pulse rate per PMT in Hz
)
Values at start of script should be modified according to detector configuration
sizeSetting currently has options;
 "default", "8in", "10inHQE", "12in", "20in"


Event Reconstruction: scripts/SandFit.C
Perform event reconstruction on output from photon mask.
void SandFit(
  TString filename,       // path to output of photon mask
  TString genfilename,    // path to WChSandBox generatorcardfile.root file or "gun" for particle gun events
  TString outfilename,    // path to reconstruction output file
  TString lnLfilename,    // path to likelihood_tables.root 
  TString lookupfilename, // path to energyLookups.root
  int startEvent,         // number of first event to reconstruct
  int maxEvents           // number of events to reconstruct
)
Low-E reconstruction code is in advanced_scripts/Low_E.C
High-E reconstruction code is in advanced_scripts/High_E.cc, advanced_scripts/High_E.h

The low-E reconstruction uses two variables which depend on detector: intercept and gradient.
These values are obtained by generating electron particle gun with fixed known energy through the detector.
By looking at the distribution of the number of PMT hits for different energies, a linear fit between energy and number of hits can be drawn.

The following two files (which need to be generated for specific detectors) are required as part of the high-E reconstruction:

likelihood_tables.root
Contains the tables of likelihoods for photons observed at given distance and angle for given particle and kinetic energy.
To generate this, use scripts/likelihoodTables.C with WChSandBox output for events generated from 50MeV to 1050MeV of Kinetic Energy.

energyLookups.root
Contains look-ups for the energy reconstruction and correction to vertex bias in the track direction.
To generate this, first run WChSandBox ouput for large number of events through advanced_scripts/RecoForLookup.C,
then use these files with scripts/EnergyLookups.C



Known limitations / planned improvements:

 - The time of detection of a hit on a PMT is simply as a gaussian centred around the true time, with no accounting for multiple photons arriving at a PMT close in time (they will be treated as each producing one photoelectron, with individually smeared detection times).
 
 - The ring searching assumes all photonelectrons are part of an identified ring if they are detected by a PMT at a time within twice the timing resolution of the PMT. This probably needs more tuning to improve ring counting performance.
 
 - The energy reconstruction is currently based off a simple lookup dependant on total number of photoelectrons, reconstructed distance from the tank wall, energy, and particle hypothesis. This should be improved by including in the likelihood fit. To do this, the likelihood should be changed from multinomial to poisson (code already exists but is commented out) and some fix is needed for a bias causing energy to be reconstructed too low - probably due to how photoelectrons are removed at the ring counting stage if not considered part of the found ring.
 
 - If there are multiple rings for an event which has enough hits to be passed to the high-E chain, but the ring itself does not have enough hits, it may be better to reconstruct using the low-E reconstruction tools, but currently it is still treated as high-E.
